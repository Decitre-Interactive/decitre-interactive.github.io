message: "The coronavirus pandemic has forced universities to swap to coolness learning. community service reflection essay example <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>essay thesis</a> is community service mandatory persuasive essay. \r\nBut what is happening now can be named an emergency delivery of content to listeners in isolation . Most of academies  and the professors themselves were not ready for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University teachers with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never utilized remote video services to participate in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds absurd. Thus, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it is funny. Colleagues from regional academies told that some professors asked to write lectures by hand and send them scans for verification.Now, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten lectures and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. Although remote physical excercises can be more originative, for example, you can do selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the public domain, and teach them to play sports online, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity teachers are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct classes on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some professors record lectures on a webcam and send them to their students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some educators ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and problems, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>developing a thesis statement</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Educators have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
