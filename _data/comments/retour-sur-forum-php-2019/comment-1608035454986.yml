message: "The coronavirus pandemic has phoney universities to change-over to distance learning. admission essay writing service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis writing</a> college essay help service. \r\nBut what is happening now can be called an crisis delivery of content to listeners in isolation . Most of colleges  and the professors themselves were not ready for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University teachers with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut educators are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its unique methods are the main function of colleges. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds absurd. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it gets funny. Colleagues from regional academies said that some teachers asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for verification.Now, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with a single button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten lectures and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they perform physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical education training can be more originative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports online, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity educators are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct classes on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, someone only sends tasks to WhatsApp. Some professors record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some professors ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>doctoral thesis</a> \r\nOnline learning  does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
